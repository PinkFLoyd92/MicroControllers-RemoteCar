# MicroControllers-RemoteCar
Final project for the microcontrollers' lab in ESPOL

Design of an anti-collisions car of n wheels.
The user can control the car's movement by the android app published in here.
Two modes possible: Manual and automatic, if the mode is manual the user can control the car by the android app,
if the car is going to collide with a wall the car will stop and will not allow the movement of it in that direction.

Automatic Mode:
The car moves depending of the user's choice, if the object has an obstable in front of him the car will avoid it
by going around it.
